EasySerial A cross-platform open source serial port debugging assistant based on QT

Serial port debugging assistant is a very suitable tool for debugging serial port equipment. There are many useful serial port debugging assistants in windows, but it seems that there is no easy-to-use software with interface on Linux system (there are still many tools for debugging with command line), but it is not so convenient to use. Therefore, based on QT's good cross platform characteristics, a simple cross platform serial port debugging assistant is developed to meet the basic serial port debugging requirements. Finally, open source sharing. The functions currently implemented include:

Search serial port equipment;

ASCII / hex receiving;

Save the received data to TXT;

ASCII / hex transmission;

Periodic transmission;

Read txt and send;

Transmit / receive byte count;
